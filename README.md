# RageRoom-UnityVR

Have you ever felt exhausted after a long day of work? Wanting to find a safe and private place to let it all out? Well, now you can. This application allows you to release all your stress and anger whenever you want and wherever you are. This is a rage room in virtual reality that gives you a baseball bat, and a lot of monitors.

This app is built in 23 hours independently by Sebastian Yang for ÂµHacks and it is the 2nd place winner in this hackathon. You can download it here: https://github.com/SCP650/RageRoom-UnityVR/releases
